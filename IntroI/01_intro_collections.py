# collections

# create an empty list? Array
# my_list = []
# my_list2 = list()

# print(my_list)

# create a list with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

# add an element 24 to lst1

# add an element 12 to the start of lst1

# print(lst1)

# # print all values in lst2
# print(lst2)
# print(lst1[0])
# print(lst1[1])
# print(lst1[2])
# print(lst1[3])
# print(lst1[4])

# loop over the list using a for loop



# while loop


# List Comprehensions

# Create a new list containing the squares of all values in 'numbers'
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = []
# print(numbers)
# print(squares)
# Filtering with a list comprehension
evens = []

# create a new list of even numbers using the values of the numbers list as inputs
# print(evens)

# create a new list containing only the names that start with 's' make sure they are capitalized (regardless of their original case)
names = ["Sarah", "jorge", "sam", "frank", "bob", "sandy"]
s_names = []
# print(s_names)




# Dictionaries

# Create a new dictionary

# empty
d = {}

# key value pairs
d2 = {
    'name' : 'Tom',
    'age' : 41
}

# access an element via its key
print(d2['name'])



# Lets think about Tuples?

# this of an imutable list --> the tuple (read only = imutable)
# good for constant values

t = (5, 7, 8, 9) # this is a tuple - can not change any of the data
